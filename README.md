# Jetsam

Jetsam is a tool designed to sanitize IRC logs stored in the [Driftwood](https://github.com/apple-fritter/driftwood) format. It helps identify and flag lines in the log files that contain potentially sensitive or inappropriate content for further review or moderation.

## Features

- Parses log files stored in the Driftwood format, separating columns using a unique Unicode character as a field separator.
- Sanitizes log lines by adding a "#" symbol in the first column to flag them for further review or moderation.
- Flexible wordlist usage: Allows the use of single wordlist files or a directory of wordlist files for customizable content sanitization.
- Supports recursive parsing of wordlist files to handle complex and nested directory structures.
- Supports log files with the .txt extension, adhering to the Driftwood format specification.

## Usage

To use Jetsam, run the following command:
```shell
jetsam <log directory path> <wordlist path>
```
- `<log directory path>`: Path to the directory containing the log files in the Driftwood format.
- `<wordlist path>`: Path to the wordlist file or directory for content sanitization.

## Output

Jetsam modifies the log files by adding a "#" symbol in the first column of sanitized lines. This modification flags the lines for further review or moderation.

#### Example Driftwood Entry:
```
â˜•12â˜•34â˜•56â˜•GitHubFAN23â˜•Hello, world!â˜•
```

This line will be modified to:
```
#â˜•12â˜•34â˜•56â˜•GitHubFAN23â˜•Hello, world!â˜•
```

#### Jetsam logfile entry
```
Timestamp: 20230613-143200
Path: /logs/freenode/programming/2003/01/01.txt
Line Number: 2
Original Line: 123456 GitHubFAN23 Hello, world!
```

## Considerations

- Input Validation: Ensure that the provided log directory and wordlist paths are valid and exist. Jetsam does not perform extensive input validation, so it's essential to validate the input to avoid errors.
- Backups: Before running Jetsam on your log files, make sure to create backups of your original files. This precaution helps prevent accidental data loss or unintended modifications.
- Data Security: Treat the log files containing potentially sensitive information with care. Take appropriate measures to protect the data, such as restricting access permissions and following security best practices.

### IRC usage considerations
When working with any project involving IRC (Internet Relay Chat), it's important to keep the following considerations in mind to ensure a positive and respectful environment for all participants.

#### Philosophy of Use
Tailor your project's behavior and responses to align with the expected norms and conventions of IRC. Take into account the preferences and expectations of IRC users, ensuring that your project provides a seamless and familiar experience within the IRC ecosystem.

#### Foster a Positive and Inclusive Environment
Respect and adhere to the guidelines and policies of the IRC platform you are using. Familiarize yourself with the platform's rules regarding script usage, automation, and acceptable behavior. Comply with the platform's Terms of Service, and be mindful of any limitations or restrictions imposed by the platform. Strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment where all users can engage respectfully and comfortably.

#### Respect the Rights and Dignity of Other Users
Maintain a polite and courteous demeanor in all interactions. Uphold the fundamental principles of respect, avoiding engagement in illegal, inappropriate, or offensive behavior. This includes refraining from using derogatory or inflammatory language, sharing explicit, triggering, or offensive content, engaging in harassment, or launching personal attacks. Obtain explicit consent before interacting with other users or sending automated responses. Respect the privacy of other users and avoid invading their personal space without their permission.

#### Respect the IRC Community and Channels
Avoid disrupting the normal flow of conversation within IRC channels. Ensure that your project's actions and responses do not cause unnecessary disruptions or inconvenience to other users. Implement mechanisms to prevent spamming or flooding the channel with excessive or irrelevant messages. Handle errors gracefully, preventing unintended behavior or disruptions to the IRC platform or the experiences of other users.

#### Ensure Compatibility
Consider the potential variations in behavior across different IRC platforms and clients. While aiming for compatibility, be aware that certain functionalities may not be available or consistent across all platforms. Test your project on multiple IRC platforms and clients to ensure compatibility and provide the best possible experience for users.
